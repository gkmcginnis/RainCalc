# Welcome! This is my amateur attempt at a website calculator.
This is a project I have worked on in various forms. <br />
Originally, I made an excel document that could perform the calculations. <br />
I felt that this was a bit too limiting, as the goal of our team was to make this as accessible as possible. <br />
In total, we made a PDF for printing and distribution, as well as the aforementioned excel document. <br />
In a spirit of inclusivity, this calculator can be accessed by anyone with internet. No need for excel, or distribution of a document. <br /><br />
This is free for homeowners, students, or designers of outdoor spaces alike. <br />
This is also, a **work in progress.**<br />

**Any and all feedback is appreciated.**<br />
